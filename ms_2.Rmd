How Couples Meet and Stay Together takes a really interesting topic and displays a wide variety of related data points in an easy to navigate manner. The data is organized very logically, and every graph/chart is placed under a title and tab which makes it very clear what you're looking at. My first main criticism would be the lack of color; on the whole, it's pretty bland to look at. I wish the coder would have changed the color schemes a bit to provide some pop. The other main drawback for me is that a few data sets are not displayed in a way that makes relationship between factors as clear as possible. For example, "Educational Attainment" and, to a lesser degree, "Political Affiliation" make it more difficult to quickly determine correlation between variables by using the grid format as opposed to a scatter plot with a line of best fit.
